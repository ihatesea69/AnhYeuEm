# Student Reward Prediction System üéì‚ú®  

This project provides a solution for analyzing student performance data and predicting appropriate reward categories based on performance metrics. It leverages data preprocessing, machine learning, and an interactive application for seamless user experience.  

## üìã Problem Statement  
The project addresses the challenge of analyzing large-scale student performance data to:  
- Identify patterns and trends.  
- Predict the appropriate reward category for students based on their performance.  
- Automate decision-making, reduce human errors, and ensure a fair distribution of scholarships and recognitions.  

## ‚ú® Key Features  

### 1. Data Extraction and Preprocessing  
- **PDF to CSV Conversion:** Utilizes `pdfplumber` to transform unstructured PDF data into a structured CSV format.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Cleanses and normalizes data for consistency and optimal analysis readiness.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Visualizations:** Uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visual insights.  
- **Key Insights:**  
  - Distribution of students across reward categories.  
  - Relationships between academic scores (GPA) and behavioral scores (ƒêRL).  

### 3. Machine Learning Model  
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier to predict reward categories based on input metrics.  
- **Performance:** Achieves an accuracy of **86%** on testing data, showcasing strong predictive capabilities.  

### 4. Interactive Prediction Application  
- **Interface:** Built using `Streamlit` for a user-friendly experience.  
- **Functionality:**  
  - Accepts input of academic and behavioral scores.  
  - Predicts the corresponding scholarship or reward category.  

## üöÄ How to Use  

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-reward-prediction.git  
   cd student-reward-prediction  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Run the Streamlit App:**  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  

4. **Input Metrics:** Provide academic and behavioral scores in the application to receive predictions.  

## üõ† Technologies Used  
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Streamlit, pdfplumber, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Random Forest Classifier.  

## üìä Results  
- Model accuracy: **86%**.  
- Insights into data trends for better decision-making in reward distribution.  

## üéØ Future Enhancements  
- Include more advanced features such as real-time data processing.  
- Expand reward categories to include diverse performance metrics.
